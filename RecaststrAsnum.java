/*
NOTES:
ARGS...
The `main` method's signature with an array of strings (`String[] args`) as its parameter
is a Java convention for the entry point of an application.
The reasons for this convention are:

1. **Command-Line Arguments**:
Java, like many programming languages,
was designed with the ability to accept command-line arguments.
These arguments are passed to the `main` method as an array of strings.
For example, if you run a Java program from the command line as:

    ```
    java MyProgram arg1 arg2 arg3
    ```

   Then inside your `main` method, `args[0]` will be `"arg1"`, `args[1]` will be `"arg2"`, and so on.

2. **Consistency**:
Using `String[]` provides a consistent interface across Java applications.
Regardless of the application's specific domain or purpose,
if someone is familiar with Java,
they'll know to look for a `main` method with that signature as the entry point of the application.

3. **Flexibility**:
Accepting an array of strings provides flexibility.
Parameters passed to the program can be of varying number
and can be parsed as needed within the program.
If the `main` method were designed to accept, say, three integer arguments,
it would be far less flexible and applicable to a wide range of scenarios.

4. **Historical Precedence**:
Other languages that predate Java, like C and C++,
also use a similar mechanism for passing command-line arguments,
though the specifics differ. Java's design likely drew inspiration from these conventions.

In summary, the array of strings (`String[] args`) as a parameter for the `main` method
provides a mechanism for passing command-line arguments to Java applications
and offers flexibility, consistency, and familiarity.
